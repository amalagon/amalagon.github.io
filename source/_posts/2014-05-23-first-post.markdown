I am a graduate student in physics at Yale; this summer I'm excited to 
be doing an internship with Openstack through the [Outreach Program for Women](https://gnome.org/opw/).
This blog will be describing the work I do for this internship, working on Ceilometer, Openstack's metering service.
My Github code is [here](https://github.com/amalagon) and you can email me
at [this address](mailto:atmalagon@gmail.com).
