Implementing moving averages, etc, a

Miscellaneous useful commands: 

using sed for string transforms
key bindings for going through the command line quickly (Ctrl+a, Ctrl+e, Ctrl+k)
Doing grep recursively
When etherpad freezes how to recover files (add /export.txt to end of url to get the content in a txt file)
running commands in the background (use ampersand)
Using restview to view .rst files
Finding the id of a running process: ps -ef | grep 'gnocchi'
